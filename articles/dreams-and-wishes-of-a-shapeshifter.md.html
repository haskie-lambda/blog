<h1 class="title">Dreams and Wishes of a Shapeshifter</h1>
</header>
<p>I came, I saw, I …</p>
<p>I wanted to be;</p>
<p>to be the guy who’s seen by me</p>
<p>to be the girl thats caught mine eye</p>
<p>to be like them, but all at once</p>
<p>to be like one, at seconds’ whim</p>
<p>“Being able to shapeshift would be so cool” - a childhoods dream
even. Probably every childs dream at some point in their make believe
games. And yet, should it become true, it might as well be an adults’
curse. Boundless possibilites fit well in a childs’ infinitely large,
ever changing world. But what of all those possibilities if one has to
live in a rigid world of rules, expectations and definite shapes? Then,
learning that you are exactly what you dreamt for, becomes its own set
of challenges.</p>
<p>What is identity? A definition? A set of characteristica? Rigid?
Fluid? Is there any such thing as the identity of something that refuses
to be defined or compared to anything? What becomes of identity, if the
identified alters their behaviour; alters their appearance?</p>
<p>Find yourself, stay true to yourself, follow your heart. What if
these conflict? If staying true to an identity is not where your heart
wanders?</p>
<p>What becomes of social relations, when you invoke feelings of
ailienation and distance, whenever you transition from one shape to the
next, sometimes in plain view in a matter of seconds? What is social
protocol for chameleons?</p>
<p>And yet, the question of what I want these to be, is more pressing
than anything else. Who if not Shapeshifters, most versatile of our
species, should be emblematic of and define, what constitutes the middle
ground, that is bounded by our current categories of the extremes? What
do I dream of, if nightmares of lived experiences lie dormant for a
while? I dream of a world, where neatly defined concepts of identity
tumble and fall, where those now seen ‘normal’ realize their extreme
position on the spectrum. I dream of a post-liberal, anti-identitarian
form of identity, based on change. The identity of a people, being their
continuous way of change, the specifics of their flexibility. The
identity of a political stream of thought its’ history and process of
adaptation. The identity of a single person their capability and
potential for change. A world, in which categories of identities cease
to have meaning, a post-intersectionality. I wish for the inquiries
“boyfriend or girlfriend?”, “straight or gay?”, “him or her?” to become
meaningless - by way of new language and revolutionary change in thought
patterns.</p>
<p>Abandon all sanity, ye who enter here! Accept a reality, in which I
see a person and ask myself “Do I wanna be like them or do I wanna be
with them?”. Accept a reality, in which I wake up, feeling like an earth
warrior and go to bed looking like a typical Arch user. Accept a reality
in which i dress to confuse and change behaviour in the blink of an eye.
Live in a world, where not only rocks, but lives are carved by fluid
change.</p>
<p>Unconformity, agitation, confusion, everlasting change, and the break
with the system are a shapeshifters identity. Such are my dreams.
Prepare to have your world torn to shreds, once you meet one of us - we
already realize them.</p>
