<blockquote>
<p>I know always that I am an outsider; a stranger in this century and
among those who are still men. This I have known ever since I streched
out my fingers to the abomination within that great gilded frame;
stretched out my fingers and touched <em>a cold and unyielding surface
of polished glass</em>. - The Outsider, H.P. Lovecraft</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Last entries in the diary of Rekim Forr</em></p>
<p><strong>1</strong></p>
<p>Unhappy are they to whom their self perception, watery mirages and
reflections aren’t strangers; to whom those are books so vastly
incomprehensible to the unwitting eye, one might never hope to evoke in
others, the sentiments engendered. Wretched are they, who look back on
uncounted aeons of self disciplined studies, tracing the movements of
their own existence. Such a lot Azathoths blind dreams have given to me;
my life, a cruel examination opposing the incomprehensible, blind, idiot
nature of the universe. And yet, I am strangely content, and cling
desperately to the knowledge inherit in my condition when challenged
with <em>the other</em>.</p>
<p>When I first realised the strageness pertaining to my reflections I
know not. For years and decades, there seemed something eerie about
these objects, that twist and turn light back on itself, rendering a
mirrored world for the beholder to inspect. Many a days have I spent
studying these images, looking for flaws or deviations from the
“reality” opposite this glassen plane, only to find it a copy, perfect
in every aspect. And yet I wondered, what a mirror might miss or what
might hide inside its mirrored world - for what if they worked both
ways?</p>
<p>In later years, I came to accept these horrid constructs - as one
does. Too often do we give in to societal conceptions of “what is”,
“what may be”, and “what must not be”. Too often do we start ignoring
warnings, brought down by our ancestors; warnings and knowledge from
beyond “what may be”. A foolish tendency, as I have learned ever so
often. Many stories, now condemed to the supersticious or fictous aimed
at scaring little children, hold darker truths - wisdom from ages long
passed; wisdom from a time where humans would wander the earth
undistracted from billboards, handheld devices and grand tales of
constant material productivity. (Sidenote in more recent script: <em>One
such truth, pertains to the hindu conception of the Ātman and its’
parallels with those sinister worlds we peer at, through
mirrors.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>2</strong></p>
<p>Returning to the world of consciousness at the end of a lengthened
meditation, I found that the grand window into the mirrored plane, with
it’s unobstructed view of my meditation room, shewed not, what it had
before: the mirrored room now housed not the soalless version of myself,
watching me through its dead, glassy eyes, reflecting my every move, but
rather the same, ghoulish figure, looking off into the distance,
horizontally rotated by 180 degrees. I was staring at a figures’ back; a
figure still mimicking me grotesquely in every detail. I ignored it,
blaming it on faulty perception and my drowsiness, for this was a thing
“what must not be”, and headed towards an uneasy sleep.</p>
<p>Upon waking and discovering the figure still turned away in every
mirror and reflective surface I could find, I headed out. Without
inquiring directly about what I was seeing - for this would get me
hospitalized before too long - I provoked and studied situations in
which others too, would see the foul thing ignorantly turning its back
on me. I rode on elevators equipped with huge mirrors, inspected the
wares of a craftsman specializing in the reflective surfaces and studied
tapes of surveillance cameras, streamed live onto screens for the public
to see. None would recognize the strageness of the world they perceived.
The expected reflections seemed to greet them - if by pure ignorance or
distraction I cannot say.</p>
<p>I have always detested this world, devoid of sound and life beyond
those glass panes, and yet I cannot bear the thought that this world may
be different and alive after all. After confirming with a trusted friend
- one with whom such matters could be discussed without risking the
involvement of a psychiatric ward - that indeed, even she could perceive
only that, which she had expected to see, I knew, a more ancient and
powerful force must be corrupting the root of my reality.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong></p>
<p><em>In similar, yet more elaborate script:</em></p>
<p>Months I have now trod the libraries and archives of cultural studies
departments across the continent. Weeks have I spent in silent
contemplation of the accounts compiled. Days have I sat unmoving, lain
in pain, screamed and danced in ecstatic meditation. My mind lost,
regained, splintered, healed, fragmented, reassembled, shattered like
the black mirror of the Temple of Zuth underneath the City of Ur.
Ygnaiih Yog-Sothoth! By all gods and outer beings, I have learned the
name and seen the nature of this corruption.</p>
<p>The Hindus were right, at least in part, for beholders we all are -
beholders not of reality, but of that which we will to be. We peer into
the world, acting our part in Azathoths dream, beholding it from within
- and yet are blind, as Azathoth themself. Humans are in nature not so
different from mirrors. Eyes are the gateway to the soal - yet if I am
to look into the eyes of the strangers I encounter, I do not see their
soal. We see not what is, but what we will to be. These eyes, touching
others with their hunger for “reality” see not the infinite complexities
of those they peer at. They look and see caricatures of human beings,
befitting their perception and understanding of the world. They look and
see not the broken soal, but will to be prey or monsters as they see
fit. Just as I can neither see my soal nor body in these horrid glassen
universes. Only few learned ones can see beyond the veil of flesh and
social construction we have built to constrain our world within.</p>
<p>There are those that peer beyond. There are those that know “what
really is”. I have gone beyond and returned to finish this account. I
shall now return and take my place as Seer beyond the gate that keeps us
from seeing “what really is”. I shall dream of you one day.</p>
